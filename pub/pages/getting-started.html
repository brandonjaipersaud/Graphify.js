            <h3>Page Setup</h3>

            <p>
                To use graphify.js, you must first include it in your page. Assuming the library is stored within the lib/ directory, this can be done by 
                inserting the following inside the head tag of your document:
            </p>

            <pre> <code> &lt;script defer type="text/javascript" src='lib/graphify.js'&gt;  &lt;/script&gt; </code> 

  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="lib/graphify.css"&gt; 
            </pre>
            <p>
                Note that this should be inserted before any scripts that depend on it.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="usingLibrary">

        <h3>Using the Library</h3>

        <p>
            First, start by creating a basic container to hold the graph canvas:
        </p>

        <pre> <code> &lt;div class='container'&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code> 
        </pre>

        <p>
            Then, within an external JavaScript file start by selecting the container:
        </p>

        <pre> <code> let ctx = document.getElementsByClassName("container")[0] </code> 
        </pre>

        <p>
            Now, let's create a new graph and add some vertices and edges:
        </p>

        <pre> <code> let graph = new Graph({}, ctx)
  let v0 = new Vertex()
  let v1 = new Vertex()
  let v2 = new Vertex() 
  let v3 = new Vertex()

  graph.addVertex(v0)
  graph.addVertex(v1)
  graph.addVertex(v2)
  graph.addVertex(v3)

  graph.addEdge(v0, v1)
  graph.addEdge(v0, v2)
  graph.addEdge(v1, v2)
  graph.addEdge(v2, v3)
            </code> 
        </pre>

        <p>
            The first parameter to Graph is a config object which allows you to customize properties such as animation speed. For now we keep
            it empty. Refer to the API to see all the customization options. The examples page also has examples of graphs that 
            use these options. The second parameter to Graph is the graph context we selected earlier. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, to display the graph call the graph.visualize() method as follows:
        </p>

        <pre> <code> graph.visualize() </code> 
        </pre>

        <p>This generates a graph based on the entered parameters. The vertex positions are randomly generated. The below graph is an example of 
            what could be generated. If you refresh the page, the below graph will look different since the vertex positions will have changed. </p>

        <div class='container'> </div>
        
        <p>
        To run either BFS/DFS: click the corresponding button, choose a starting vertex, 
        then click the execute algorithm button and enjoy the animation! This is a basic undirected 
        graph with 4 vertices. Checkout the examples page for a slightly larger graph.
       </p>

    </section>

    <section class="interactive"> 


        <h3>Interactive Mode</h3>

        <p>
            This mode enables you to interactively create a directed graph with edge weights. It also
            gives you the option of running Dijkstra's algorithm in addition to BFS and DFS. This cannot be
            done with graphs created in the non-interactive mode.
        </p>

        <p>
            Start by creating a new container like before:
        </p>

        <pre> <code> &lt;div class='container'&gt; &lt;/div&gt; </code> 
        </pre>

        <p>
            Then, create a new graph and pass a config object to it. Note that we set graphBuilder to true
            to turn on the interactive graph builder mode. We also set the styles.dimensions property which alters the 
            dimensions of the graph container. Refer to the API to see in detail what these properties mean and how to configure
            them.
        </p>

        <pre> <code> 
            ctx = document.getElementsByClassName("container")[1]

            let graph = new Graph({
                graphBuilder: true,
                 styles: {
                    dimensions: [100, 400]
                 }
            }, ctx)

            graph.visualize()
                      </code> 
        </pre>

        <p>
            This creates an interactive window below enabling you to create your graph. Follow the instructions
            below to create the graph. First, you add vertices, then edges, then edge weights. When the graph is 
            finished constructing, you can use it in the same way as the other graphs above to animate algorithms.
        </p>


        <div class='container'> </div>


        <p>
            Try running Dijkstra's algorithm when you have finished constructing the graph!
        </p>
