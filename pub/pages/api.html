        <h3>Methods</h3>


        <pre> <code> graph.addVertex(v0)
  graph.addEdge(v0, v1)
  graph.visualize()
  graph.setDFSSpeed('fast')
  graph.setBFSSpeed('fast')
  graph.setDijkstraSpeed('fast')
    </code> </pre>

  <p>
      Note that the animation speed of the algorithms can be manually set in either the Graph config object or 
      by calling the appropriate method above once the Graph has been created.

    <h3>Animation Notes</h3>

    <p> The meaning of the vertex labelling during the animation comes from the implementation of the algorithms in 
        the CLRS textbook. Below, I have briefly outlined how the vertices are labelled for each algorithm.
    </p>

    <h4>BFS</h4>

    <p>The vertices get labelled with their shortest distance from the starting vertex.
        Q=[] represents the unexplored vertices that have been added to the BFS queue.
    </p>

    <h4>DFS</h4>

    <p>Each vertex gets labelled with s/f where s denotes when the vertex was first visited and f denotes 
        when the vertex has finished being explored. 
    </p>

    <h4>Dijkstra</h4>

    <p>Each vertex is labelled with its Dijkstra score.
    </p>

<section>
    <h3>Why Can't Dijkstra's Algorithm be Used in Non-Interactive Mode?</h3>

    <p> You might be wondering about the question above. Namely, Dijkstra's algorithm can only be run in the graph-builder/interactive 
        mode. This is because it is difficult to place edge weights in the randomly generated graphs in non-interactive mode. Thus, the 
        algorithms in non-interactive mode are limited to ones that don't use edge weights.
    </p>
